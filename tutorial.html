                                      In most cases, every time you purchase an investment, it will cost you money.</p>

                                    For example,if you want to purchase five different stocks at the same time,

                                     <p>Imagine that you are deciding to purchase the stocks of five companies with $1,000. To do this you will incur $50 in trading costs, which is equivalent to 5% of $1,000.
                                     For example, if you want to purchase five different stocks at the same time, this is seen as five separate trades and you will be charged for each one.
                                     If you were to sell these five stocks, you would once again incur the costs of the trades, which would be another $50.
                                     To make the round trip on these five stocks it would cost you $100, or 10% of your initial deposit amount of $1,000. If your investments don't earn enough to cover this, you have lost money by just entering and exiting positions.</p>

                                    <h3>4: Mutual Fund Fees</h3>
         
                                    <p>There are many fees an investor will incur when investing in mutual funds.
                                    One of the most important fees to focus on is the management expense ratio (MER), which is charged by the management
                                    team each year based on the amount of assets in the fund. The higher the MER, the worse it is for the fund's investors.
                                    In terms of a beginner investor, the mutual fund fees are actually an advantage relative to the commissions on stocks. The reason for this is that the fees are the same regardless of the amount you invest. So, as long as you have the minimum requirement to open an account, you can invest as little as $50 or $100 per month in a mutual fund. </p>

                                    <p>Diversification is considered to be the only free lunch in investing.
                                    In a nutshell, by investing in a range of assets, you reduce the risk of
                                    one investment's performance severely hurting the return of your 
                                    overall investment. You could think of it as a financial jargon for 
                                    not 'putting all of your eggs in one basket'.
                                    
                                    <p>For beginners with a small amount of money, it is nearly impossibl e to have a well-diversified portfolio, 
                                        so be aware that you may need
                                    to invest in one or two companies (at most) to begin with. This will increase your risk.</p>
                           
                                    <p>This is where the major benefit of mutual funds comes into focus.
                                    Mutual funds tend to have a large number of stocks
                                    and other investments within the fund, which makes the fund 
                                    more diversified than a single stock.</p>
