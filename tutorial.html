You know what, if you don’t do this, you may end up paying a lot of money to settle all the charges rather than earning your pot of gold. Don’t worry, you can count on us for fee.

                                     <p>Every time that you trade stock, either buying or selling, you will incur a trading fee. For example,if you want to purchase five different stocks at the same time, this is seen as five separate trades and you will be charged for each one. But we don’t do that. We just ask a penny if you earn money.</p>

                                    <p>Imagine that you are deciding to purchase the stocks of five companies with $1,000. To do this you will incur $50 in trading costs, which is equivalent to 5% of $1,000. For example, if you want to purchase five different stocks at the same time, this is seen as five separate trades and you will be charged for each one. If you were to sell these five stocks, you would once again incur the costs of the trades, which would be another $50. To make the round trip on these five stocks it would cost you $100, or 10% of your initial deposit amount of $1,000. If your investments don't earn enough to cover this, you have lost money by just entering and exiting positions.</p>

                                    <h3>6: Reduce Risk with Diversification</h3>
                  
                                    <p>Diversification is considered to be the only free lunch in investing.
                                   In a nutshell, by investing in a range of assets, you reduce the risk of
                                   one investment's performance severely hurting the return of your 
                                   overall investment. You could think of it as a financial jargon for 
                                   not 'putting all of your eggs in one basket'.</p>
                                   
                                   <p>For beginners with a small amount of money, it is nearly impossible to have a well-diversified portfolio, so be aware that you may need to invest in one or two companies (at most) to begin with. This will increase your risk.</p>
                           
                                    <p>This is where the major benefit of mutual funds comes into focus.
                                   Mutual funds tend to have a large number of stocks
                                   and other investments within the fund, which makes the fund 
                                   more diversified than a single stock.</p>
